# Movsynth

A simple script made in python that calculates the coordinates for the hinges of a four-bar linkage, where a point associated with the coupler passes through 3 arbitrary points.  

It can help synthesize a four-bar linkage that passes through 3 points in a straight line for an example. I tried it and  3D printed a small one completely functional.

I plan to add other synthesys methods to this script.
